## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Cache invalidation delay | Low | Low | 5-min TTL, manual clear endpoint |
| High API load | Medium | Medium | Rate limiting, caching, auto-scaling |
| i18n key missing | Low | Low | Pre-deployment verification, tests |
| Accessibility regression | Low | Medium | Automated WCAG tests, manual audit |
| Database scaling | Low | High | Monitoring, partitioning, read replicas |

### Contingency Plans

1. **If cache not clearing**: Manually trigger `DELETE /api/leaderboard/cache`
2. **If API overloaded**: Enable emergency rate limiting (5/min), disable non-critical features
3. **If database down**: Failover to read replica, notify stakeholders
4. **If critical bug**: Rollback to previous version using git revert
5. **If performance degradation**: Scale up Appwrite Functions, add CDN cache
