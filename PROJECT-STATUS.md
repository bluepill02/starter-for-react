- [ ] Review Phase 3A integration guide (`PHASE3A-RELIABILITY-INTEGRATION.md`)
- [ ] Review example implementation (`PHASE3A-INTEGRATION-EXAMPLE.js`)
- [ ] Run deployment script: `node scripts/deploy-phase3a.js`
- [ ] Verify health-check endpoints are responding

**After Deployment**:

- [ ] Update create-recognition function with idempotency middleware
- [ ] Update verify-recognition function with idempotency middleware
- [ ] Update export-profile function with idempotency middleware
- [ ] Add request logging to critical paths (create, verify, export)

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Phase (3A)
- ✅ Idempotency working but requires integration
- ✅ Request logging structured but needs aggregation setup
- ✅ Safe migrations ready but untested on large datasets
- ✅ Health checks created but not wired to monitoring

### Next Phase (3B)
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Add circuit breaker for third-party integrations
- Implement per-org quota enforcement

### Future (3C & Beyond)
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Advanced distributed tracing with context propagation
- Multi-region federation support
- Advanced audit analysis and compliance reporting

## Contact & Support

For implementation questions or integration help:

1. Review `/PHASE3A-RELIABILITY-INTEGRATION.md` for detailed guide
2. Check `/PHASE3A-INTEGRATION-EXAMPLE.js` for code patterns
3. Refer to service documentation in function headers
4. Run test suite: `npm run test`

---

## Next Action

**Ready to proceed?** Execute Phase 3A deployment:

```bash
node scripts/deploy-phase3a.js
```

This will:
1. ✅ Deploy health-check function
2. ✅ Verify idempotency service is ready
3. ✅ Test all endpoints
4. ✅ Save deployment log

**Then** integrate Phase 3A services into existing functions following the integration guide.

**Last Updated**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Phase 3A Complete, Ready for Deployment  
**Next Milestone**: Phase 3B (Deployment Safety) - 2-3 days  
**Project Completion**: ~2-3 weeks (all 3 phases)
