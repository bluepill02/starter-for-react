## UI/UX Audit Update — Recognition App (Pages and Components)

Date: October 18, 2025

This update provides an accurate, file-referenced UI/UX audit of all user-facing pages and core components in the repository. It corrects earlier overstatements and lists focused improvements to ensure high quality, accessibility, and private-by-default behavior.

Key takeaways

- Most primary flows are solid: sign-in, recognition creation, feed browsing, basic profile and export, and admin abuse review.
- Accessibility is thoughtfully considered in critical flows (form validation, ARIA live regions), though focus trapping and centralized live regions can improve.
- Internationalization is implemented but inconsistently applied across pages.
- Some pages diverge stylistically (e.g., inline styles); unify with Tailwind for consistency and dark-mode coverage.
- There are duplicate implementations for feed and profile; consolidate to one authoritative component to reduce drift.

### Corrections to earlier report claims

- Feed filters/search: The page at `apps/web/src/pages/feed.tsx` does not implement filters/search; those live in `apps/web/src/components/RecognitionFeed.tsx`. Recommendation: reuse the component in the page or remove the page-specific duplicate.
- Analytics charts/time controls: The current `apps/web/src/pages/analytics.tsx` shows metric cards, shares-by-platform, top recognition, and CSV export, but no chart library widgets or time selector UI. Keep claims aligned to what exists today.
- Profile tabs: The page `apps/web/src/pages/profile/[userId].tsx` presents a single-page layout (no tabs). Don’t claim a tabbed interface.

### Pages and key components reviewed

#### 1) Sign-in — `apps/web/src/pages/sign-in.tsx`
- Strengths
  - OAuth (Google, Microsoft) + email fallback; clear loading/disabled states.
  - Accessible form: labels, role="alert" errors, large/tappable buttons.
  - Clean visual hierarchy; helpful copy and divider.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Add “Forgot password?” entry point to reduce support friction.
  - Add autocomplete hints: autocomplete="email" and autocomplete="current-password"/"new-password".
  - Provide ToS/Privacy links (currently copy-only).
  - Announce OAuth redirect start via polite ARIA live region for SR users.

#### 2) Recognition creation — `apps/web/src/components/RecognitionModal.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Private-by-default visibility; clear radio choices (Private, Team, Public).
  - Draft autosave to localStorage; restores on reopen; clears on success.
  - Validation: required recipient email, tags present, minimum reason length with live counter and minLength.
  - Evidence upload via `useEvidenceUpload`; drag/drop, browse, limits display, accessible file list with remove buttons.
  - Screen reader announcements for success and errors.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Add Escape-to-close and a proper focus trap within the modal; return focus to the opener on close.
  - Provide recipient autocomplete (directory or MRU) to reduce input errors.
  - Limit tag string length and normalize case; add suggested tags list for discoverability.
  - Show inline thumbnail previews for images (preview data already produced by hook).
  - Add a submit button aria-busy state and disable while uploading/submitting.

#### 3) Evidence upload — `apps/web/src/lib/useEvidenceUpload.ts`
- Strengths
  - Zod-based validation (types and size); clear per-file error state; max files.
  - Presign + direct Storage upload; asynchronous preview function trigger; ARIA announcements for progress.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Centralize an aria-live region instead of creating/destroying multiple DOM nodes.
  - Show a visible determinate progress bar per file using `uploadProgress`.
  - Consider client-side image resizing for large images to improve upload speed.

#### 4) Recognition feed —
   - Page: `apps/web/src/pages/feed.tsx`
   - Component: `apps/web/src/components/RecognitionFeed.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Infinite scroll via IntersectionObserver; skeletons and retry states; display of weight, status, visibility.
  - Manager verification controls with SR announcements on result; optimistic create pipeline in the page version.
  - Component version includes filter UI (visibility, status, time range) and reset/empty states.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Duplicate implementations between page and component; consolidate on `RecognitionFeed` and pass options. The page version lacks filters/search claimed earlier.
  - Consider list virtualization for very long feeds to reduce DOM cost.
  - Use names instead of raw emails in visible text to reduce PII exposure; show email on hover or only when necessary/authorized.
  - For Reject, prompt for a mandatory note (modal) instead of using a hard-coded string.

#### 5) User profile — `apps/web/src/pages/profile/[userId].tsx`
- Strengths
  - Shows summary metrics; export to PDF/CSV via function; SR announcements for export status.
  - Clear access gating (own profile, MANAGER, ADMIN) with error page and return CTA.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Exposes emails prominently; prefer display name and reveal email with intent or role.
  - Add tabs or simple filters to separate “Given” vs “Received” vs “All” in a persistent, scannable way (or reuse the other `ProfilePage` component which has view modes).
  - Confirm export includes a verifier stamp and hashed IDs per product spec; reflect options in UI text.
  - Add deep links to recognitions and a filter by tags or status.

#### 6) Leaderboard — `apps/web/src/pages/leaderboard.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Clear header, helpful legend; dark mode supported; accessible list semantics; error/loading/empty handled well.
  - Filter bar via `LeaderboardFilter` with period and type.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Consider SR descriptions for how ranking is computed; add aria-describedby to the list.
  - Provide a link-style navigation to profiles using a router link instead of `window.location.href` for SPA feel and focus preservation.

#### 7) Analytics — `apps/web/src/pages/analytics.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Informative metric cards; shares-by-platform breakdown; top recognition card; CSV export; dark mode; loading/error states.
- Gaps and improvements
  - No actual charts/time-range controls in UI; either add simple charts (e.g., sparkline) or tune copy to match present functionality.
  - Avoid hardcoded fetch to `/api/analytics` from the client if auth context differs; ensure UI reflects error states gracefully. From UX: add a retry button.
  - Add a visible period selector if multiple periods are supported by backend.

#### 8) System health — `apps/web/src/pages/system-health.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Simple status display; auto-refresh toggle; helpful colors per state.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Uses inline styles—migrate to Tailwind for visual consistency and dark mode.
  - Add semantic landmarks, headings, and ARIA where appropriate; use status badges with consistent styling.

9) Admin abuse review — `apps/web/src/pages/admin/abuse.tsx`
- Strengths
  - Comprehensive filters; risk scoring; suggested actions; justification required for overrides; good badge patterns.
  - Clear stats cards and prioritized list; good empty/error handling.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Replace mock auth with `useAuth()/RequireRole` to guard the page; add i18n keys (currently fallback t()) and wire to `useI18n`.
  - Add confirmation modals for destructive actions and require justification input before enabling the action.
  - Consider a details drawer/modal for a selected case for reduced scroll workload.

10) Language/i18n — `apps/web/src/lib/i18n.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`
- Strengths
  - English and Tamil JSONs loaded; browser/timezone heuristics; localStorage persistence; hook + imperative translate API.
- Gaps and improvements
  - Inconsistent adoption across pages—many strings are hardcoded in English. Apply `useI18n` for headings, buttons, labels, errors.
  - Add SR-only locale change announcement when switching languages.

---

Cross-cutting UX quality
- Accessibility
  - Pros: labels/aria on inputs and buttons; live regions for progress; keyboard-friendly controls; status badges with color + text.
  - Improve: add modal focus trap/escape; centralize a single aria-live region to reduce DOM churn; ensure all icon-only controls have aria-labels (audit pass suggests this is mostly done).
- Privacy and security
  - Positive: private-by-default recognitions; export gated by role/ownership; evidence presign upload avoids proxying raw files.
  - Improve: prefer names over emails in public views; avoid logging PII from UI; ensure export UI text mentions hashed IDs and timestamp/verifier stamp.
- Consistency
  - Use Tailwind across all pages; migrate inline-styled health page; ensure dark mode variants for feed/profile to match analytics/leaderboard.
- Performance
  - Infinite scroll is implemented; consider virtualization for long lists; lazy-load image previews; memoize expensive maps where needed.

---

Prioritized fixes (high value, low risk)
1) Consolidate feed implementations
   - Route `apps/web/src/pages/feed.tsx` to reuse `components/RecognitionFeed` or remove page-specific duplicate; keep optimistic create via an up-prop.
2) Modal a11y hardening
   - Add focus trap and Escape handling to `RecognitionModal`; restore focus to trigger on close.
3) Reduce PII exposure
   - Display names by default; reveal emails conditionally or on hover; update feed and profile headers accordingly.
4) Central aria-live region
   - Provide a single live region component mounted at app root; update hooks/components to use it.
5) System Health styling
   - Migrate to Tailwind and add dark mode; semantic headings and status badges.
6) i18n adoption
   - Replace hardcoded strings across pages with `useI18n`; add keys to `/i18n/en.json` and `/i18n/ta.json`.
7) Manager reject note UX
   - Replace hard-coded reject note with a confirm modal requesting a reason; announce outcomes via live region.

Readiness summary (today)
- Core flows usable and accessible; a few consistency and a11y polish items remain.
- After the prioritized fixes above, the app will better align with “private-first” and “Tamil-first” product goals and present a fully consistent, enterprise-ready UI.
