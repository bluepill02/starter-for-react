## Code Reuse Checklist

✅ **Don't rewrite these—extend them:**

- `i18n.ts` → Add Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam
- `LanguageSwitcher.tsx` → Add 3 more language options
- `ManagerVerification.tsx` → Add checkboxes for bulk select
- `HRExportSystem.tsx` → Add advanced filters & compliance tools
- `export-profile/index.ts` → Add portfolio PDF & batch processing
- `ProfilePage.tsx` → Add shareable link + portfolio tab
- `en.json` & `ta.json` → Add onboarding, pricing, commercial keys
- `bootstrap-seed/index.ts` → Add recognition templates

❌ **Build these fresh (no conflicts):**

- `ShareProfile.tsx` - New component for shareable links
- `WeeklyDigest.tsx` - New email template component
- `PricingPage.tsx` - New page for tier selection
- `SignupFlow.tsx` - New onboarding wizard
- `OnboardingTour.tsx` - New guided tour component
- `ProfilePortfolio.tsx` - New portfolio display
- `ManagerChecklist.tsx` - New manager setup guide

## Key Decisions Ahead

**Q1: Where do you want to start?**

Option A: **UX First** (Phase 6A)
- Best for: Improving existing customer satisfaction
- Risk: Slower revenue growth
- Impact: High retention, strong foundation

Option B: **Growth First** (Phase 6B)
- Best for: Maximizing viral adoption
- Risk: Requires existing user base
- Impact: Exponential user growth

Option C: **Revenue First** (Phase 6C)
- Best for: Unlocking commercial model
- Risk: Pricing pressure on SMBs
- Impact: Immediate revenue, enterprise positioning

Option D: **All Three (Parallel)**
- Best for: Maximum momentum
- Risk: Resource constraints
- Impact: Market leadership

**Q2: Language support priority?**

Current: English, Tamil  
Proposed: + Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi

Cost: ~20 hours per language (translation + testing)

**Q3: Who's your target customer for 6C?**

- SMB with 50-500 employees → Free tier focus
- Enterprise (500+) → DPA/compliance focus
- Startup (< 50) → Growth mechanics focus

- `/docs/PART6-AUDIT-EXISTING-VS-REQUIRED.md` - Full audit
- `/docs/hr-integration.md` - HR API patterns
- `/docs/PHASE2-LOGGING-ERROR-HANDLING.md` - Error handling patterns

**To review before starting:**
```bash
# 1. Accessibility patterns
cat /apps/web/src/components/RecognitionModal.tsx

# 2. i18n patterns  
cat /apps/web/src/lib/i18n.ts

# 3. HR workflows

## Next Action Items

**For you to decide:**
1. Which phase to tackle first (6A, 6B, or 6C)?
2. Language support priorities?
3. Target customer profile?

**For the team to prepare:**
1. Review `/docs/PART6-FOUNDATION-ASSETS.md`
2. Identify component reuse opportunities
3. Plan i18n key additions
4. Set up email templating infrastructure (for digests)

**For continuous deployment:**
- All Part 6 changes will use same test patterns as Phase 5
- Jest unit tests required for every new service
- Playwright smoke tests for every user flow
- CI/CD via existing GitHub Actions workflow

---

## Key Constraints

- **PII Handling:** Use hashed IDs only in exports, telemetry, logs
- **Export Format:** PDF with verifier stamp + CSV with anonymization toggle
- **Audit Trail:** Every action (create, verify, export, admin override) creates RecognitionAudit entry
- **Rate Limits:** 10 recognitions/day/giver (enforced by abuse service)
- **Presigned URLs:** 24-hour expiration on all file downloads
- **Email:** Never send raw evidence, use digest format
- **Integrations:** Slack/Teams must validate signatures before processing

---

## Quick Start When Ready

```bash
# Step 1: Choose your phase
# Step 2: Review asset files
cp /docs/PART6-FOUNDATION-ASSETS.md /your/notes.md

# Step 3: Start with existing component
# Example: Extend ManagerVerification for bulk operations
# - Modify: /apps/web/src/components/ManagerVerification.tsx
# - Add checkbox selection state
# - Add bulk approve button
# - Test with 5+ recognitions

# Step 4: Follow existing test patterns
# - Create Jest tests in /packages/tests/ManagerBulkVerify.test.tsx
# - Add Playwright E2E tests
# - Check coverage (target: 95%+)

# Step 5: Add i18n keys
# - Update /i18n/en.json
# - Update /i18n/ta.json
# - Test with LanguageSwitcher

# Step 6: Create audit trail entry
# - Use existing RecognitionAudit pattern
# - Log action, actor, timestamp, hashed IDs
```
