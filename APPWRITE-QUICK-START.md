## üîß Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Set Environment Variables

```powershell
# Set your Appwrite credentials
$env:APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://syd.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
$env:APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="68f2542a00381179cfb1"
$env:APPWRITE_KEY="dev-key"
```

### 2. Create Appwrite Database & Collections

```bash
npm run appwrite:setup
```

**Expected output:**
```
[INFO] Setting up database: recognition-db
[SUCCESS] Database already exists: recognition-db
[SUCCESS] Collection already exists: recognitions
[SUCCESS] Collection already exists: users
...
‚úÖ Appwrite integration setup completed successfully!
```

### 3. Test Integration

```bash
npm run appwrite:test
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Passed: 9
‚ùå Failed: 0
Total:  9
Pass Rate: 100%

üéâ All integration tests passed!
```

### 4. Start Development

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start Appwrite emulator (if using locally)
npm run dev:emulator

# Terminal 2: Start dev servers
npm run dev:all

# Or separately:
npm run dev:web      # React frontend (port 3000)
npm run dev:api      # API functions (port 3001)
```

### 5. Test OAuth

1. Open http://localhost:3000/sign-in
2. Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft"
3. You'll be redirected to the OAuth provider
4. After authentication, you'll be redirected to the feed page
5. ‚úÖ OAuth is working!

2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete OAuth in popup
4. Should redirect to /feed
5. User profile should display
```

### Rate Limiting

# Test recognition rate limit
# Create 11 recognitions (limit is 10/day)
# Requests 1-10: Success ‚úÖ
# Request 11: 429 Too Many Requests ‚úÖ
```

### Audit Logging
```bash
# Query audit logs

  -d '{
    "eventCode": "RECOGNITION_CREATED",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Suspicious Activity Detection
```bash
# Test auth failures detection
# Try 6 failed sign-ins from same IP
# Should be detected as suspicious
```

## üìû Troubleshooting

### OAuth Not Working

**Problem:** Redirect loop or "Invalid session"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` matches Appwrite project URL
2. Check Google/Microsoft OAuth callback URL matches exactly
3. Verify credentials are active in Appwrite console
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

### Rate Limiting Not Working

**Problem:** Can create more than 10 recognitions/day

**Solutions:**
1. Check rate limiter middleware is integrated into `create-recognition` function
2. Verify rate limit key format is consistent: `recognition_daily:${userId}`
3. Check function returns rate limit headers
4. Verify in-memory store isn't cleared between requests

### Audit Logs Missing

**Problem:** No audit entries appearing in database

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `audit-entries` collection exists
2. Check `createAuditLog` calls are being made
3. Verify database write permissions
4. Check API key has database collection access

### Collection Not Found

**Problem:** "Collection recognition-db/recognitions not found"

**Solutions:**
1. Run `npm run appwrite:setup` to create collections
2. Verify collections exist in Appwrite console
3. Check DATABASE_ID and collection IDs match env variables
4. Ensure API key has database access

## üìà Monitoring & Operations

### Key Metrics to Track

```
- OAuth sign-in success rate (target: >99%)
- Rate limit breaches per hour (target: <10)
- Audit log entries volume (track trends)
- Authentication failure rate (alert if >1%)
- Database query performance (target: <100ms)
```

### Daily Checks

```
‚òê OAuth sign-in working
‚òê No error spikes in logs
‚òê Rate limits functioning
‚òê Database performance normal
‚òê Audit logs being generated
```

### Weekly Maintenance

```
‚òê Review audit logs for suspicious patterns
‚òê Check database performance metrics
‚òê Test disaster recovery procedures
‚òê Verify backups are completing
‚òê Review and rotate API keys if needed
```
