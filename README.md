# Recognition App - React + Appwrite

A secure, evidence-first recognition platform built on React and Appwrite, featuring Tamil-first localization, anti-abuse detection, and enterprise-grade security.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Appwrite Cloud account or self-hosted instance
- Storage bucket configured for file uploads

### Quick Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/appwrite/starter-for-react
cd starter-for-react
npm install
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### 1. Appwrite Configuration
Create `.env.local` files based on the examples:

**Web App** (`/apps/web/.env.local`):
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=evidence-storage
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=main-db
```

**API Functions** (`/apps/api/.env.local`):
```env
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-server-api-key
APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=evidence-storage
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=main-db
```

### 2. Appwrite Resources Setup

Create these collections in your database:
- `recognitions` - Core recognition data
- `recognition_audits` - Audit trail for all operations
- `evidence_previews` - File preview and security metadata
- `users_extended` - Additional user profile data

Create storage bucket with these permissions:
- Read: `role:member` (authenticated users)
- Create: `role:member`
- Update: `role:admin`
- Delete: `role:admin`

### 3. Required Appwrite Functions

Deploy these server-side functions:
- **presign-upload** - Secure upload authorization and audit logging
- **evidence-preview** - Thumbnail generation and content security scanning
- **create-recognition** - Recognition creation with abuse detection
- **verify-recognition** - Manager verification workflow

### 4. Install Dependencies & Run

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Run E2E tests (requires Appwrite setup)
npm run test:e2e
```

## üîí Security Features

### Evidence Upload Security
- **Zod Validation** - Runtime schema validation for all uploads
- **Content Scanning** - Automatic security flag detection
- **Size Limits** - 50MB max per file with type restrictions
- **Presigned Uploads** - Server-authorized upload tokens prevent abuse
- **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all upload operations

### Privacy-First Design
- **Private by Default** - All recognitions default to private visibility
- **Hashed Identifiers** - No PII in logs or telemetry
- **Short-lived Previews** - Evidence served via temporary URLs only
- **Role-based Access** - Manager verification requirements with RBAC

### Anti-Abuse Protection
- **Rate Limiting** - 10 recognitions per day per user (configurable)
- **Reciprocity Detection** - Automatic flagging of suspicious patterns
- **Content Analysis** - Evidence weight adjustments based on quality
- **Manual Review** - Admin override capability with required justification

## üåê Internationalization

### Tamil-First Localization
The app prioritizes Tamil language support:

```javascript
// Usage in components
import { useI18n } from '../lib/i18n';

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useI18n();
  return <h1>{t('recognition.title')}</h1>;
}
```

Language files:
- `/i18n/ta.json` - Tamil (primary)
- `/i18n/en.json` - English (fallback)

### Adding New Translations
1. Add keys to both language files
2. Use descriptive key paths: `feature.component.element`
3. Include context for translators in comments

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test                    # All unit tests
npm run test:watch             # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Coverage report
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e              # Full E2E suite
npm run test:e2e:headed       # With browser UI
```

Test files structure:
- `/packages/tests/*.test.js` - Unit tests
- `/packages/tests/e2e/*.spec.js` - E2E tests

### Appwrite Emulator Testing
```bash
# Start local Appwrite for testing
npm run test:setup
npm run test:e2e:local
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Audit Trail
All operations create audit entries:
- Recognition creation/verification
- Evidence uploads/access
- Admin actions and overrides
- Integration activities (Slack/Teams)

### Telemetry
Privacy-compliant metrics:
- Hashed user IDs only
- No content or PII logging
- Aggregate usage patterns
- Performance monitoring

## üîß Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
```
/apps/web/          # React frontend (Vite)
/apps/api/          # Appwrite Functions
/packages/schema/   # Shared Zod types
/packages/tests/    # Test suites
/i18n/             # Localization files
/infra/            # Deployment configs
```

### Key Components
- **Evidence Upload System** - Secure file handling with preview generation
- **Recognition Modal** - Accessible form with real-time validation
- **Admin Dashboard** - Abuse monitoring and override capabilities
- **Export System** - PDF/CSV generation with privacy controls

### Data Flow
1. User uploads evidence ‚Üí Presign validation ‚Üí Secure storage
2. Recognition creation ‚Üí Abuse detection ‚Üí Manager notification
3. Verification process ‚Üí Weight calculation ‚Üí Audit logging
4. Export request ‚Üí Server-side rendering ‚Üí Temporary download

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment variables
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your-production-endpoint
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=prod-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=prod-server-key
