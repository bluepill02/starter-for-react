# 🎯 PART 5 DISCOVERY REPORT - October 18, 2025

## ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE

You asked: **"CHECK FOR EXISTING LOGIC FIRST: Observability telemetry and incident response (Part 5 of 6)"**

### 🎉 What We Found

**2,000+ lines of production-ready observability infrastructure ALREADY EXISTS** from Phase 3B.

Rather than building from scratch, Part 5 focuses on **activation and integration**.

## ❌ What's Missing (Part 5 Scope)

- Prometheus server setup
- Grafana dashboards
- AlertManager configuration & rules
- On-call rota
- Runbooks (5+ failure scenarios)
- Error grouping logic
- Incident response procedures
- PII scrubbing verification

**Effort: 37 hours to complete all items**

## 🚀 Quick Win: 2.5 Hours to First Metrics

### Step 1: Expose Metrics Endpoint (30 min)
```javascript
import { exposeMetrics } from './services/metrics-exporter.js';
app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
  res.type('text/plain');
  res.send(exposeMetrics(metrics));
});
```

### Step 2: Wire Metrics (1 hour)
- Record execution time in create-recognition
- Record execution time in verify-recognition
- Record execution time in export-profile

### Step 3: Add Prometheus (1 hour)
- Add to docker-compose.dev.yml
- Configure scrape endpoint
- Verify data flowing

### Result
✅ Real-time metrics flowing into Prometheus  
✅ Prometheus dashboard at http://localhost:9090  
✅ Ready for Grafana

## 📈 SLOs Already Defined

Your system has these Service Level Objectives ready to monitor:

```
create-recognition:     99.9%  availability | 500ms  latency P99 | 0.1%  error rate
verify-recognition:     99.95% availability | 1000ms latency P99 | 0.05% error rate
export-profile:         99.5%  availability | 5000ms latency P99 | 0.5%  error rate
delete-recognition:     99.9%  availability | 300ms  latency P99 | 0.1%  error rate
get-audit-export:       99.5%  availability | 3000ms latency P99 | 0.5%  error rate
```

**These are implemented in slo-monitoring.js** — just need to activate!

## 💡 Key Insight

**Build on what exists. Don't rebuild.**

✅ Metrics framework: Done  
✅ Tracing framework: Done  
✅ SLO definitions: Done  
✅ Health checks: Done  
✅ Audit logging: Done  

Your job: Activate + enhance + document
